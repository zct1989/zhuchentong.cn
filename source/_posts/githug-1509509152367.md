```
使用`--local`为设置仓库级别配置，使用`--global`为设置全局级别配置

Level: 3
---
Name: add
Level: 3
Difficulty: *

There is a file in your folder called `README`, you should add it to your staging area
Note: You start each level with a new repo. Don't look for files from the previous one.

了解git add 命令，学会添加文件到版本库:
```
git add .
```

<!--more-->

Level: 4
---
Name: commit
Level: 4
Difficulty: *

The `README` file has been added to your staging area, now commit it.

了解git commit命令，学会提交已经被add的文件的更改:
```
git commit -m 'add README'
```

Level: 5
---
Name: clone
Level: 5
Difficulty: *

Clone the repository at https://github.com/Gazler/cloneme.

学会clone命令检出项目:

```
git clone https://github.com/Gazler/cloneme
```
Level: 6
---
Name: clone_to_folder
Level: 6
Difficulty: *

Clone the repository at https://github.com/Gazler/cloneme to `my_cloned_repo`.

使用clone命令，可以检出到指定名称的目录:
```
git clone https://github.com/Gazler/cloneme  my_cloned_repo
```

Level: 7
---
Name: ignore
Level: 7
Difficulty: **

The text editor 'vim' creates files ending in `.swp` (swap files) for all files that are currently open.  We don't want them creeping into the repository.  Make this repository ignore those swap files which are ending in `.swp`

了解如何忽略不想被进行版本库管理的文件，通过编辑`.gitignore`可以完成改操作，首先打开`.gitignore`文件:
```
.profile.yml
.gitignore
```

修改为
```
.profile.yml
*.swp
```

Level: 8
---
Name: include
Level: 8
Difficulty: **

Notice a few files with the '.a' extension.  We want git to ignore all but the 'lib.a' file.

这一关还是学习`.gitignore`文件的配置,使用`!`可以对目标文件进行排除，修改`.gitignore`文件如下:

```
*.a
!lib.a
```

Level: 9
---
Name: status
Level: 9
Difficulty: *

There are some files in this repository, one of the files is untracked, which file is it?

这一关是学习git status命令，通过改变可以了解当前的提交状态

```
git status
```
可以知道，未被版本追踪的文件是`database.yml`

Level: 10
---
Name: number_of_files_committed
Level: 10
Difficulty: *

There are some files in this repository, how many of the files will be committed?

这一关和上一关一样，只不过是询问提交文件的数据同样使用
```
git status
```
进行查看，结果是`2`

Level: 11
---
Name: rm
Level: 11
Difficulty: **

A file has been removed from the working tree, however the file was not removed from the repository.  Find out what this file was and remove it.

Level: 12
---
Name: rm_cached
Level: 12
Difficulty: **

A file has accidentally been added to your staging area, find out which file and remove it from the staging area.  *NOTE* Do not remove the file from the file system, only from git.

本关要求是删除文件的版本管理追踪但是并不删除文件，使用`--cache`参数即可完成:

```
 git rm deleteme.rb --cache
```
Level: 13
---
Name: stash
Level: 13
Difficulty: **

You've made some changes and want to work on them later. You should save them, but don't commit them.

这一关要求是，保存一些不想被提交的文件:

```
git stash
```
Level: 14
---
Name: rename
Level: 14
Difficulty: ***

We have a file called `oldfile.txt`. We want to rename it to `newfile.txt` and stage this change.

这一关要求是对文件进行重命名操作，直接重命名文件会被版本库视为丢失，所以需要进行如下操作:

```
git mv oldfile.txt newfile.txt
```

Level: 15
---
Name: restructure
Level: 15
Difficulty: ***

You added some files to your repository, but now realize that your project needs to be restructured.  Make a new folder named `src` and using Git move all of the .html files into this folder.

这一关还是考察`git mv`，需要把根目录下的所有`html`文件移动到一个名为`src`的目录中:

```
mkdir src
git mv *.html src/
```
Level: 16
---
Name: log
Level: 16
Difficulty: **

You will be asked for the hash of most recent commit.  You will need to investigate the logs of the repository for this.

本关要求通过查看提交记录，找到对应提交的hash值:
```
git log
```

Name: tag
Level: 17
Difficulty: **

We have a git repo and we want to tag the current commit with `new_tag`.

本关的目的是学习创建tag:

```
git tag new_tag
```
Level: 18
---
Name: push_tags
Level: 18
Difficulty: **

There are tags in the repository that aren't pushed into remote repository. Push them now.

这一关是学会提交tag:
```
git ps origin --tag
```
Level: 19
---
Name: commit_amend
Level: 19
Difficulty: **

The `README` file has been committed, but it looks like the file `forgotten_file.rb` was missing from the commit.  Add the file and amend your previous commit to include it.

本关是说如何将忘记提交的文件加入上一次提交

```
git ci --amend
```

Level: 20
---
Name: commit_in_future
Level: 20
Difficulty: **

Commit your changes with the future date (e.g. tomorrow).

本关是说如何指定提交日期，通过`--date`可以完成该操作

```
git ci --date=2018/12/22 -m 'update'
```

Level: 21
---
Name: reset
Level: 21
Difficulty: **

There are two files to be committed.  The goal was to add each file as a separate commit, however both were added by accident.  Unstage the file `to_commit_second.rb` using the reset command (don't commit anything).

这一关是考察`git reset`命令，使用`git reset`将使用仓库中的版本来覆盖暂存区的版本，而使用`git checkout`则是用暂存区的版本去覆盖工作区的版本

```
git reset HEAD to_commit_second.rb
```

Level: 22
---
Name: reset_soft
Level: 22
Difficulty: **

You committed too soon. Now you want to undo the last commit, while keeping the index.

这一关还是对`git reset`命令的考察，reset有三个参数

* --soft 参数将上一次的修改放入 staging area
* --mixed 参数将上一次的修改放入 working directory
* --hard 参数直接将上一次的修改抛弃

那么我们知道撤销commit应该是使用`--soft`

```
git reset --soft HEAD^1
```

撤销回之前的一次即可

Level: 23
---
Name: checkout_file
Level: 23
Difficulty: ***

A file has been modified, but you don't want to keep the modification.  Checkout the `config.rb` file from the last commit.

这次是对checkout的考察，之前说过reset是从仓库还原，checkout是从暂存区还原

```
git checkout config.rb
```

再附加的说一下，git的存储分为三部分：

* 工作区
* 暂存取
* 版本库

如果有服务端那么不过是增加了一个远程版本库

工作区一般就是文件目录，以及实际的文件内容

暂存取是指一般通过`git add`命令后进行存储的区域

如果执行`git commit`命令那么就是从暂存区保存到版本库

这是git需要搞清楚的一个概念

Level: 24
---
Name: remote
Level: 24
Difficulty: **

This project has a remote repository.  Identify it.

这一关是说如何查看远程版本库

```
git remote
```

Level: 25
---
Name: remote_url
Level: 25
Difficulty: **

The remote repositories have a url associated to them.  Please enter the url of remote_location.

这一关是上一关的延伸，是说如何查看远程版本库地址:

```
git remote show remote_location
```

Level: 26
---
Name: pull
Level: 26
Difficulty: **

You need to pull changes from your origin repository.

这一关是说如何从远程版本库更新代码:

```
git pull origin master
```

Level: 27
---
Name: remote_add
Level: 27
Difficulty: **

Add a remote repository called `origin` with the url https://github.com/githug/githug


这一关是说如何手动添加远程版本库:

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/githug/githug
```

Level: 28
---
Name: push
Level: 28
Difficulty: ***

Your local master branch has diverged from the remote origin/master branch. Rebase your commit onto origin/master and push it to remote.

这里说考察代码的推送，以及分叉处理，可以理解为本地数据库更新以后本地发生了更改并且提交到了版本库，远程也发生了更改，也进行了提交，这是需要先进行合并然后进行提交

```
git rebase origin/master
git ps origin master
```

Level: 29
---
Name: diff
Level: 29
Difficulty: **

There have been modifications to the `app.rb` file since your last commit.  Find out which line has changed.


这一关是对`diff`命令的考察,`diff`也有三种参数:

* git diff: 查看工作区和暂存取之间的差异
* git diff --cached: 查看版本库和暂存取之间的差异
* git diff HEAD: 查看工作区和版本库之间的差异

上面的问题是说最后一次commit之后的修改，那么使用:

```
git diff
```

Level: 30
---
Name: blame
Level: 30
Difficulty: **

Someone has put a password inside the file `config.rb` find out who it was.

这关考察的是如何查看每一行的历史记录:

```
git blame config.rb
```

Level: 31
---
Name: branch
Level: 31
Difficulty: *

You want to work on a piece of code that has the potential to break things, create the branch test_code.

本关考察如何创建分支:

```
git branch test_code
```

Level: 32
---
Name: checkout
Level: 32
Difficulty: **

Create and switch to a new branch called my_branch.  You will need to create a branch like you did in the previous level

本关考察如何切换分支:

```
git branch my_branch
git co my_branch
```

当然还有一种更简单的方法:

```
git branch -b my_branch
```

Level: 33
---
Name: checkout_tag
Level: 33
Difficulty: **

You need to fix a bug in the version 1.2 of your app. Checkout the tag `v1.2`.

本关考察如何切换到对应的tag版本上:

```
git checkout v1.2
```

Level: 34
---
Name: checkout_tag_over_branch
Level: 34
Difficulty: **

You need to fix a bug in the version 1.2 of your app. Checkout the tag `v1.2` (Note: There is also a branch named `v1.2`).

如果分支和tag重名是，使用上一关的方法会切换到对应的分支上，需要明确指出要切换的是一个tag:

```
git co tags/v1.2
```

Level: 35
---
Name: branch_at
Level: 35
Difficulty: ***

You forgot to branch at the previous commit and made a commit on top of it. Create branch test_branch at the commit before the last.

本关的要求是根据每一次commit创建分支，需要在创建分支时指定对应的commit

```
git branch test_branch c92e8cd
```

Level: 36
---
Name: delete_branch
Level: 36
Difficulty: **

You have created too many branches for your project. There is an old branch in your repo called 'delete_me', you should delete it.

这一关是学习如何删除分支:

```
git branch -d delete_me
```

Level: 37
---
Name: push_branch
Level: 37
Difficulty: **

You've made some changes to a local branch and want to share it, but aren't yet ready to merge it with the 'master' branch.  Push only 'test_branch' to the remote repository

这一关是学习如何向远程版本库推送指定分支:

```
git ps origin test_branch
```

Level: 38
---
Name: merge
Level: 38
Difficulty: **

We have a file in the branch 'feature'; Let's merge it to the master branch.


这一关是学会如何合并分支:

```
git merge feature
```

Level: 39
---
Name: fetch
Level: 39
Difficulty: **

Looks like a new branch was pushed into our remote repository. Get the changes without merging them with the local repository


这一关是了解git pull 和 git fetch区别，其实git pull 是结合了git fetch 和 git megre两个操作的集合，git fetch是仅仅从远程库下载代码，git megre是将远程库下载的代码和本地进行合并，git fetch下载的代码应该会存储在一个名为FETCH_HEAD的指针中

```
git fetch
```

Level: 40
---
Name: rebase
Level: 40
Difficulty: **

We are using a git rebase workflow and the feature branch is ready to go into master. Let's rebase the feature branch onto our master branch.

这一关是考察rebase命令，rebase认为是合并基准，就是说如果一些分支的修改成分叉状，使用rebase可以将分叉的修改重新变为线状，以使更个分支的提交记录显得更加简洁

```
git checkout feature
git rebase master
```

这个命令表示将feature上的修改线性合并到master上

可以通过

```
git log --graph --all
```

查看分支的合并以及分离状况

Level: 41
---
Name: rebase_onto
Level: 41
Difficulty: **

You have created your branch from `wrong_branch` and already made some commits, and you realise that you needed to create your branch from `master`. Rebase your commits onto `master` branch so that you don't have `wrong_branch` commits.


还是考察`git rebase`,这是主要是理解`onto`参数

```
git rebase --onto master wrong_branch
```

Level: 42
----
Name: repack
Level: 42
Difficulty: **

Optimise how your repository is packaged ensuring that redundant packs are removed.


对未打包的松散对象进行打包:

```
git repack -d 
```

好吧，对这个命令是使用场景确实不太明白,认为这是提交之前的一部分操作

Level: 43
---
Name: cherry-pick
Level: 43
Difficulty: ***

Your new feature isn't worth the time and you're going to delete it. But it has one commit that fills in `README` file, and you want this commit to be on the master as well.


本关考察的是`cherry-pick`命令，它的作用是将一个分支上的commit应用到其他分支上:

```
git co master
git cherry-pick ca32a6d
```

Level: 44
---
Name: grep
Level: 44
Difficulty: **

Your project's deadline approaches, you should evaluate how many TODOs are left in your code

这一关是学习`git grep`命令，它可以对代码进行查询:

```
git grep TODO
```

Level: 45
---
Name: rename_commit
Level: 45
Difficulty: ***

Correct the typo in the message of your first (non-root) commit

这一关的目的是修改历史提交信息，需要使用`git rebase -i`命令:

```
git rebase -i 991cdf5
```

参数版本号表示修改某次提交之后的提交，会列出在这次提交之后的提交进行修改

reword表示为修改commit

将`pick`修改为`reword`然后修改message信息即可

Level: 46
---
Name: squash
Level: 46
Difficulty: ****

You have committed several times but would like all those changes to be one commit


本关的目的是将多次commit进行合并，同样是使用`git rebase`命令

```
git rebase -i be2a494
```

将`pick`修改为`squash`或`s`则代表将本次commit合并入上一次commit

Level: 47
---
Name: merge_squash
Level: 47
Difficulty: ***

Merge all commits from the long-feature-branch as a single commit

本关的要求是将分支上的所有提交合并成一个提交，然后应用在主分支上:

```
git megre --squash long-feature-branch
```

`--squash`参数表示将该分支上的所有commit合并后进行提交在该分支上

Level: 48
---
Name: reorder
Level: 48
Difficulty: ****

You have committed several times but in the wrong order. Please reorder your commits.

本关要求是修改commit的顺序，同样是使用`gir rebase -i`

```
git rebase -i c471612
```

然后对commit位置进行调整即可

Level: 49
---
Name: bisect
Level: 49
Difficulty: ***

A bug was introduced somewhere along the way.  You know that running `ruby prog.rb 5` should output 15.  You can also run `make test`.  What are the first 7 chars of the hash of the commit that introduced the bug.

这关考察的是问题定位，使用`git bisect`命令，我对这个命令理解也不是很透彻,大概用法如下

* git bisect start
* git bisect good fb088248
* git bisect bad master
* git bisect run make test
* git bisect reset 回到之前执行 git bisect start 的状态。

通过定位正常的版本位置和错误的版本位置，然后找出首个出错的版本:

```
git bisect start master f60882
git bisect run make test
```

Level: 50
---
Name: stage_lines
Level: 50
Difficulty: ****

You've made changes within a single file that belong to two different features, but neither of the changes are yet staged. Stage only the changes belonging to the first feature.

这关需要解决的问题是，如果对一个文件进行了修改，但是只想提交里面的部分修改应该如何操作，也是有个有用的技能

```
git add -p feature.rb
```

选择`e`进行编辑，删除掉不想提交的部分即可

Level: 51
---
Name: find_old_branch
Level: 51
Difficulty: ****

You have been working on a branch but got distracted by a major issue and forgot the name of it. Switch back to that branch.

这一关是忘记了之前修改的分支，希望找到之前的分支名称，使用的是`git reflog`命令，它可以查看操作记录

```
git reflog
```

很方便可以找到之前的分支，需要注意的是顶部的操作记录是最新的

Level: 52
---
Name: revert
Level: 52
Difficulty: ****

You have committed several times but want to undo the middle commit.
All commits have been pushed, so you can't change existing history.

这关要求是撤销之前的commit修改，当然因为已经被commit过，revert回作为一个新操作被追加，需要注意的是revert操作仅仅会撤销指定的commit，但是reset则会撤销从指定点以后的所有操作

```
git revert d68e848
```

Level: 53
---
Name: restore
Level: 53
Difficulty: ****

You decided to delete your latest commit by running `git reset --hard HEAD^`.  (Not a smart thing to do.)  You then change your mind, and want that commit back.  Restore the deleted commit

这一关是说如果通过`reset`撤销了一个版本如何还原，方法是通过git reflog 查看找到之前的版本id即可

```
git reflog
git co 63de674
```

Level: 54
---
Name: conflict
Level: 54
Difficulty: ****

You need to merge mybranch into the current branch (master). But there may be some incorrect changes in mybranch which may cause conflicts. Solve any merge-conflicts you come across and finish the merge.

这一关没什么多说的，也是常遇到的问题，代码冲突，手动解决冲突即可:

```
git merge mybranch
vim poem.txt
githug
```

Name: submodule
Level: 55
Difficulty: **

You want to include the files from the following repo: `https://github.com/jackmaney/githug-include-me` into a the folder `./githug-include-me`. Do this without manually cloning the repo or copying the files from the repo into this repo.

这一关是说如何添加子依赖，如果一个仓库中依赖以来另一个仓库，那么通过通过`submodule`进行添加:

```
git submodule add https://github.com/jackmaney/githug-include-me ./githug-include-me
```

如果一个项目有子模块那么检出是不会更新子模块内容需要通过`--recursive`来同时检出子模块

```
git clone xxx --recursive 
```

更新子模块代码也需要在根目录执行

```
git submodule update
```

Level: 56
---
Name: contribute
Level: 56
Difficulty: ***

This is the final level, the goal is to contribute to this repository by making a pull request on GitHub.  Please note that this level is designed to encourage you to add a valid contribution to Githug, not testing your ability to create a pull request.  Contributions that are likely to be accepted are levels, bug fixes and improved documentat

恭喜你如果看到这里，那么你已经通关了，这里是希望你通过提交pull request来为githug这个项目作贡献，希望你提交意见和问题的修正.

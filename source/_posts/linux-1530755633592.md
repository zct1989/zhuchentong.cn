实现node1到node2的 ssh免密登录步骤如下

1.生成秘钥<node1>

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa

Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:rkz4se9E84W3at6v/V2HspuvUsruZX79vMuRIigPcHQ root@manage01
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|                 |
|                 |
|       . E       |
|      . .  .     |
|     . .S . o    |
|     .oo o.o.. ..|
|    . oooo.+=..+o|
|     + =+ =*.=+.*|
|      =oo*=.OB+=O|
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

2.秘钥传送至远程主机<node>

```
 ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub  <node2 IP地址>
 
 root@192.168.3.3's password:
 Now try logging into the machine, with "ssh '192.168.3.3'", and check in:
 .ssh/authorized_keys
 to make sure we haven't added extra keys that you weren't expecting.
```
 
3.尝试登录
 
 ```
 ssh root@192.168.3.3
 ```
